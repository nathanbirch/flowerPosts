# Posts Application

The Posts Application is comprised of two separate projects that are both contained in this repository.

- There is a Node.js backend written in TypeScript. This API can be found in the **backend** folder.
- There is a React frontend built with Redux-Saga that can be found in the **frontend** folder.

## How to install and run

Both of these projects have respective readme files which provide detailed documentation on how to run these projects. In short though, you'll run the following commands in both the **backend** and the **frontend** folders:

The backend will run on http://localhost:8080. The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

Additionally in each folder, you may also run these commands:
